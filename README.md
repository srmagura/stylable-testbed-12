## Docs

1. Docs seem a bit too focused on how to get started from a premade Stylable boilerplate. I felt like I had to jump around the docs too much to get everything set up with Next.js and TypeScript.
2. The [Project Commons doc](https://stylable.io/docs/guides/project-commons) was confusing to me. It could be improved by explaining the code sample that is shown.
3. The documentation on variables seems to be "hidden" in the API section of the site [here](https://stylable.io/docs/references/st-variables). I think this should be introduced much earlier on in the docs because variables are so fundamental.

## VS Code Integration

1. `.st.css` files have the default icon in the explorer, which makes it look like an unrecognized file type.
2. Need automatic formatting like Prettier ðŸ¤‘.

## Bugs

1. It seems to be broken with the `app` directory in Next.js 13: https://github.com/wix/stylable/issues/2773
2. The VS Code extension produced this error when I typed `@st-import [colorBody] from ''`:

   ```text
   Message: Request textDocument/documentColor failed with message: Can't resolve '' in '/home/srmagura/Documents/stylable-testbed-2/src/components'
   Code: -32603
   ```

## Problems I hit that probably weren't bugs

1. My `.st.css` files generate namespaces with lots of numbers at the end, like `Home3386628209`. Is this expected? I thought one of the benefits of Stylable was that I was supposed to get easily-readable BEM-style class names by default.
2. I added a new variable `containerPaddingX` to `project.st.css`, used it in `Navbar.st.css`, and then saved both files at once. The Webpack plugin printed the error `[error: 05015]: cannot resolve imported symbol "containerPaddingX" from stylesheet "../styles/project.st.css"`. When I restarted the Next dev server, there were no errors. It seems like this could be a problem where the file watcher didn't wait for both files to be saved before performing its compilation.
3. I got the warning `[warning: 00002]: unscoped class "container" will affect all elements of the same type in the document` from the following code, and I do not understand why. If I change `.container` to `.container1`, the warning goes away.

   ```css
   @st-import [container] from '../project.st.css';

   .container {
     -st-extends: container;
   }
   ```

## Feature Requests

1. Would like `//` comments in `.st.css`. Sass allows this.
2. It would feel a bit more natural me to read variables using `$` like other languages. E.g. if the variable is `foobar`, I could do `color: $foobar;` instead of `color: value(foobar);`.
